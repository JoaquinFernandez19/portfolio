## History

This is my first attempt to create a nice looking portfolio, to add my projects while learning,
so i can showcase my progress an history to recruiters.

It only uses basic web technologies, no fancy frameworks or backend things, but that is because
i don't have that leve yet, but i will update this portfolio with some incredible features as i learn them.



## Summary

-Creted the html
-Style it, make it responsive and ''''pretty'''
-Used javascript to add some life to it, for example, if you click the 'email' button a the left, it will open a box with my email, wich you can copy
-Also, for the sake of using javascript, added a slideshow for projects wich a lot of pages or projects where i can use multiple images.

## Hope you like it, this was created in aprox 3 days.
